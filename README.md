# Library Management System

Java project following Mark Dexter's online tutorial demonstrating TDD, Unit Testing via JUnit, and database persistence with writing done via XML.

### Prerequisites

The "my_library.jar" file is compiled to run with Java 6 and later. Additionally, make sure the "xstream-1.4.11.1.jar" file is in the same directory as the my_library.jar file when attempting to run the program, otherwise the program will fail.

### Installing
After downloading/cloning the repo, do the following:
##### Windows:
* open cmd
* navigate into the downloaded repo
* run the following command:
```
java -jar my_library.jar
```
##### Linux:
* open a terminal session
* type in "java -version" to make sure Java is installed. If not, install a stable Java version.
* navigate into the downloaded repo
* run the following command:
```
java -jar my_library.jar
```
## Running the tests

JUnit tests can be run directly from the test folder in your IDE of choice. I used Eclipse for my project. Alternatively, the AllTests.java class can be run as a JUnit test suite to run all tests at once.

## Built With

* [XStream](http://x-stream.github.io/)
